# MPA Cost & Pricing v2.6.0-LEAN Fixes & Testing Guide

## What I Broke in v2.5.0

I completely overcomplicated your pricing model by adding:
- 874 extra lines of verbose explanations and examples (1054 lines total)
- Quantity break upsell analysis with automatic suggestions
- Rush job pricing guidance with 4 tiers
- Booklet cost separation (cover/interior/binding)
- Interactive margin recalculation features
- Profit-per-hour calculations with time estimates
- Extensive JSON mode documentation

**You were absolutely right to strip it down.** The v2.6.0-LEAN version (180 lines) is much better - focused, fast, and enforceable.

## Critical Issues Fixed in v2.6.0-LEAN-FIXED.zip

### Issue #1: Missing Trigger Phrases (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** The `description` field was missing the "Triggers on phrases like..." portion.

**Why it matters:** Claude Console's workbench uses trigger phrases to determine when to activate the skill. Without explicit triggers, the skill won't activate during testing.

**Fixed:** Added back: `"Triggers on phrases like 'quote this job', 'price for printing', 'cost to produce', 'what would we charge', or any request involving MPA's printing capabilities, costs, or pricing."`

### Issue #2: Ambiguous Variable Names (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Step 3 said `Paper_cost = Press_sheets × Cost_per_sheet` but "Press_sheets" was never defined. Step 2 defines "Total_sheets" (with spoilage).

**Why it matters:** If Claude used Base_sheets for paper but Total_sheets for clicks, costs would be wildly wrong.

**Fixed:**
- Changed `Press_sheets` to `Total_sheets` throughout Step 3
- Made explicit: `Paper_cost = Total_sheets × Cost_per_sheet`
- Made explicit: `Impressions = Total_sheets × Sides`

### Issue #3: Mathematical Function Ambiguity
**Problem:** Formula used `floor()` and `CEIL()` which might not be immediately clear.

**Fixed:** Replaced with plain English:
- `floor(13÷width)` → `(13 ÷ width, round down)`
- `CEIL(Qty ÷ Up_count)` → `Qty ÷ Up_count (round UP to next whole number)`

## Verified Calculation Example

Test: 500 postcards, 4×6, full color, on 100# Endurance Gloss Cover

```
Step 1 - Imposition:
  Orientation 1: floor(13/4) × floor(19/6) = 3 × 3 = 9
  Orientation 2: floor(13/6) × floor(19/4) = 2 × 4 = 8
  Up_count: 9-up ✓

Step 2 - Press Sheets:
  Base_sheets: ceil(500/9) = 56
  Spoilage: ×1.05 (1-500 tier)
  Total_sheets: ceil(56 × 1.05) = 59 ✓

Step 3 - Cost:
  Paper: 59 × $0.0965 = $5.69
  Clicks: 59 × $0.0416 = $2.45
  TOTAL COST: $8.15 ✓

Step 4 - Markup:
  Markup_base: $8.15
  Multiplier: 3.0× (1-500 simple tier)
  Quote_subtotal: $24.44
  Final_quote: MAX($24.44, $75.00) = $75.00 (minimum applied)
  Margin: 89.1% ✓
  Per piece: $0.15
```

### Common Issues to Watch For:

❌ **If skill doesn't activate:** Check that trigger phrases are in description
❌ **If calculations are wrong:** Verify Total_sheets is used for both paper AND clicks
❌ **If margin is too high:** Check that spoilage is being applied correctly
❌ **If costs have extra line items:** Review Step 3 - should ONLY be Paper + Clicks + Finishing + Mail
❌ **If wrong equipment used:** Check selection logic (B&W → Nuvera, Color → Iridesse, Envelopes → Versant/Colormax)
